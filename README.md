# IMPORTANT

The mod is currently abandoned, as I have other projects to work on on top of my last 2 years of college. Tho be reassured, a rewrite is planned as soon as the next ULTRAKILL update drops. Hopefully that also allows me to fix all the recurring issues with the mod.

# USTManager

This is the successor to UKMusicReplacement, built from scratch to be easier to work with

# Installation

Install from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/ZedDev/USTManager/) either manually or using r2modman OR build from source and manually add the mod to your plugins folder

# Known issues

- Secret levels don't work directly, but using the global sound replacement should work

# Roadmap

- UST Editor
- Sorting in the menu
- Shuffle (i'm not that sure about this one)
